Since the holidays are approaching and most of us are busy I wanted to do an intro discussion into web development. This topic is good for both the designers and developers, rookies and experienced alike. Something many of us take for granted but very good information non the less.... How do you convert a design into a working website?

My technique is one I have adapted over the years and also hoping by talking about it someone might also expose some areas for improvement. Others might find this information useful for future projects or to understand how companies and organizations handle workflow and deliverables.

####Topics:

* Accepting a comp - developers checklist
* Interpreting a comp - convert layout into markup and css 
* Interacting with comp - adding interactions and javascript 
* New Tech - handling responsive and retina displays

Since our time is short I will try to cover as much of the subject as I can while still leaving time for Q&A.
