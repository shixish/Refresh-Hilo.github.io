A few years ago I found a tool to help automate some of my deployment processes... I use LAMP stack servers but this tool works for many other environments. I will go thru setting it up and doing some test deployments. If you are still using FTP or pushing Git packages to your production server... this tool will help you and save your time.
[Check out the website](http://capistranorb.com/) to learn a little about Capistrano before the meetup. Also will be doing some announcements, a repeat of last months meetup. New website, and hackathon for charity in Hilo. Hope to see you all next Tuesday. -Edward Meehan
