Edward Meehan is going to do an extension of the talk that he did about converting design comps to pages. In the first talk, he covered some pre-dev checklists, basic layout structure and techniques. This time around he will go a little deeper into layout using the bootstrap framework, and building with a templating in mind. Also some use cases for CMS, and static pages.

This will also be the first attempt at a remote talk.
