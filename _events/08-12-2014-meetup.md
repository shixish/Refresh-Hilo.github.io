Designers welcome! Our past two meetups have been very development focused, I wanted to change it up a little and invite the designers to return or attend. Also discuss the idea of throwing a Hack-A-Thon event here in Hilo. Please RSVP for the event if you have not already done so.

####Topics:

* **iOS Prototyping with StandIn** - Laurie Filiak will be presenting some software for you mobile designers or anyone interested in learning some mobile design software.
* **Hilo Hack 4 Charity** - Discuss the idea of doing a small 48hr hack-a-thon here in Hilo for charity. Put the idea out and see if it sticks. Would be a good way of helping promote Hilo and the web community here.

####Post Event Follow up
Another great event, thank you Laurie Sumiye for doing a demo of Stand In. Was also our first successful broadcast, a few bumps but not bad for winging it.
