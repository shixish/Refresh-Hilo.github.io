This months meetup will be focused on AngularJS, we will have a few memebers talking about different features. What is AngularJS? Here is the discription from [their website](https://angularjs.org/).

<div class="well">HTML is great for declaring static documents, but it falters when we try to use it for declaring dynamic views in web-applications. AngularJS lets you extend HTML vocabulary for your application. The resulting environment is extraordinarily expressive, readable, and quick to develop.</div>
