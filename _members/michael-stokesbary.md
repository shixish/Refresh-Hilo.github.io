Michael Stokesbary has been involved in computers since he was about 10 with his first computer being a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A that he programmed BASIC on and saved his programs on ordinary audio cassette tapes. Since then, Michael has learned various programming languages and primarily focuses on .NET technologies including C#, WPF, WCF, SharePoint, and ASP.NET. Michael has also recently taken more of an interest in web technologies with a focus on TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, KnockoutJS, AngularJS and anything else that sounds cool for "web stuff".  

Michael obtained a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Gonzaga University. When not geeking out with either his computer or various User Groups he is a part of, he enjoys spending time with his 2 sons, daughter, and lovely wife as well as doing just about anything that involves the outdoors (especially volleyball and soccer).
