His friends say he's "living the dream." After leaving a lucrative career in the NY Metro area, Donnie now lives in Hilo Hawaii while his wife pursues her career. No longer bound to a corporate lifestyle, Donnie is enjoying the sun, sea, and land -- and most importantly teasing his mainland friends.

Donnie is an experienced Senior Systems Architect and Instructor. He encourages software practices that promote code quality and transparency and discourages Cowboy, Diva, and Lone-Wolf behaviors. With a decades worth of experience, he's comfortable in the legal, finance, news/media, and government space.

Although he once swore off Java to become a Pythonista, he now prefers Java technologies for any large project. When working alone, Javascript is his language of choice. High level software topics that interest Donnie are Test-Driven-Development, Design Patterns, Functional Programming, Dependency Injection, and Agile methodologies. He has a BS in Computer Science from SDSU and an ALM in Software Engineering from Harvard Extension School.

In his abundant free time, Donnie enjoys international travel, photography, craft cocktails, and learning how to sail.
