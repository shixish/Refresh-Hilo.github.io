Andrew Wessels was born in Salem Massachusettes, but moved to Hawaii when he was around 2 years old. He has lived in or around Hilo for most of his life. Andrew got started writing software in his early teens, mostly tinkering and experimenting with web technology as well as Flash. By the end of highschool, he had aquired a good understanding of PHP, MySQL, C++, Visual Basic (6 and .net), Flash (both Actionscript 2 and 3) and had started to gain an interest in Javascript programming. 

Andrew spent the next few years completing his Bachelors degree in Computer Science from the University of Hawaii at Hilo. During his time as a student there, he competed in ACM programming competitions, and contributed to the publication of 3 scientific papers. Andrew also became one of the lead web developers of the Hawaii EPSCoR reporting portal. This website is used by several hundred people across the state who recieve research funding under the Statewide EPSCoR grant. The site is used to track research opperations, and to generate reports that are sent to the National Science Foundation. This work sparked a national interest, and the project spun off into a second version, involving developers from 7 states (Alaska, New Hampshire, New Mexico, Utah, Rhode Island, Delaware, and Hawaii). Andrew served as one of the lead developer on the project, and an interim manager for a short period of the project.

Andrew now lives in Hilo, and is working as a freelance web developer. He plays table tennis almost every weekend, and likes to play video games with friends.
