Edward Meehan has been creating in the digital space for over ten years for a gamut of reputable companies. Now a veteran web developer, Edward started down the career road with his passion for video editing and art, which quickly evolved into front-end web development. Edward now runs a web development studio in San Diego, building online solutions for digital creatives, startups and marketing agencies around the nation. You can find him in the water around north county surfing and snapping pictures or at a local brewery sampling fine craft beers.

He was not always surrounded by technology. Edward grew up on the Big Island of Hawaii in a rural area of Puna. His family lived off the grid, no phone or power lines, and used solar power and CB radios until he was in his early teens. He attributes his desire to learn and explore because of his upbringing. Self proclaimed nomad, Edward has traversed the US and lived in six states.

Edward now lives in San Diego, and still loves to explore thru art, learning and travel.
